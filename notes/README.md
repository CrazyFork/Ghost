# all my notes reside in this folder

## docs
in order to freely use indention to organize doc, all the note files all end with .txt
instead of .md


## Notations:

  # inside src code:
  :bm                   #bookmark
  :bm:<tag>             # eg. :bm:error
  :todo | :todo:
  :                     # comment by myself

  # this doc
  !             #high value
  ?             #todo
