# all my notes reside in this folder

## docs
in order to freely use indention to organize doc, all the note files all end with .txt
instead of .md


## Notations:

  # inside src code:
  :bm                   #bookmark
  :bm:<tag>             # eg. :bm:error
  :todo | :todo:
  :done                 # done with todo
  :                     # comment by myself
  :skip                 # unread code, normally it's because complex, & app domain logic, hence value for tech reason

  # this doc
  !             #high value
  ?             #todo
